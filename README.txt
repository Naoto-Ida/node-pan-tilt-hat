Node Pan-Tilt HAT library
(c) 2017 Roger Hardiman

This library provides an easy way for NodeJS applications to use the Raspberry Pi Pan-Tilt HAT (made by Pimoroni) with the AdaFruit Pan/Tilt assembly.
It spawns a background Python process to communicate with the Pan-Tilt HAT and this Python process make use of Pimoroni's Python libraries.
You must install Python and install the Pimoroni Pan-Tilt HAT Python libraries before using this code.

This library provides two APIs
1) Pimoroni API
The library impements
   pan(angle)
   tilt(angle)
   servo_one(angle)
   servo_two(angle)

2) Continual Move API
The API is based on analogue CCTV systems where a a command will start the pan
or tilt motors moving and the motors contiune to move until a stop command
is issued.
The API commands are
  pan_left(speed)
  pan_right(speed)
  tilt_up(speed)
  tilt_down(speed)
  stop()
The library constantly re-computes the absolute angle for the pan and tilt based on the previous position and the current speed.

Applications
------------
The library is being used in the Raspbery Pi ONVIF Server project (RPOS) that
turns a Pi + Pi Camera + Pan-Tilt HAT + AdaFruit Pan/Tilt assembly
into an ONVIF Profile S CCTV Camera.
